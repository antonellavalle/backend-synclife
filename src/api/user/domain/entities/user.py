Module that defines the User entity.

This module contains the User class, which represents the user entity in the
application domain. It encapsulates attributes such as uuid, email, password,
full_name, birth_date, phone, account_verified, is_deleted, created_at, and updated_at.
Additionally, specific validations are performed; for example, in the birth_date setter
it is verified that the user is at least 16 years old and that the date is not later
than the current date.
